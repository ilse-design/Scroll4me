Privacy Statement for Scroll4Me

Effective date: 27-10-2025

Who we are

Scroll4Me is an experimental, non-commercial Chrome extension created by Ilse Pouwels. It automates a short scroll of your public feeds to surface relevant posts and reduce time spent doomscrolling.

What data we access

Public content only:

LinkedIn and Instagram posts that are publicly accessible.

No access to private posts, DMs, or content behind logins or paywalls.

Local app settings:

Your Focus Profile (selected platforms, interests, and rules).

Your OpenAI API key, if you choose to provide one.

What data we send to OpenAI (for filtering)

When filtering is enabled, the extension sends only minimal and trimmed post data to the OpenAI API:

Platform name (e.g. “LinkedIn”, “Instagram”)

Author display name (if publicly visible)

Post text (up to ~600 characters)

Boolean for whether the post contains an image (no image URLs)

Original post URL (for deduplication)

Your locally stored Focus Profile context (interests/tags)

Your OpenAI API key is used only to authenticate requests to OpenAI and is never shared elsewhere.

Where data is stored

Local only: All data (Focus Profile, API key) is stored in your browser’s local storage.

No servers: Scroll4Me operates no external server or cloud database.

Third-party processing: OpenAI processes limited post data for filtering. Please refer to OpenAI’s privacy terms for details on temporary data retention.

What we do not do

No collection or sale of personal data

No analytics, tracking, or advertising

No access to private messages or hidden data

No long-term storage beyond your own browser

Security
